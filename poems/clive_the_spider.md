# Clive the spider 

Your name is Clive.  
You are the spider  
That is still alive  
In spite of three times  
That I have thrown you  
Out of my window.  

I like you Clive.  
You killed Fred,  
A bluebottle  
I kept trying to throttle  
As he dive-bombed my bed.  
So just for today  

You can stay.
