# Teenagers 

In front of all their friends  
They embraced in the pub  
Kissing like it was new.  
Later they fought in bed  
Holding each other close  
Until their eyes drew shut  
And sleep joined their embrace.  

With the sun on his back  
The boy walked down the street  
To catch the train back home  
With the early workers  
And the serial shoppers.  
He thought to himself that  
Being sixteen was heaven  

Then he realised that  
He was nearly twenty-seven.
