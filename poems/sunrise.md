# Sunrise 

With imperfect timing you return.  
Like a malfunctioning watch.  
Constant but irregular.  

You chase the shadows in my room away,  
Like the schoolboys that run for the last bus.  
Commuters groan at your sharp arrival,  
And factory workers deride your face.  

So why should you announce your feverous  
Self through my glass and ill-fitting curtains?  
You postponed your incessant appearance  
For old Odysseus and Penelope.  

But not it would seem for me.  

For here in my lover's arms I am safe  
From the imperfect world outside my door  
There is no war, no poverty, no hate.  
But your arrival forces us apart  

And me out into another new day.
