# Winston

Your look-alike was famous  
For his cigars   
And two-fingered salute.  

You are only   
Two weeks old  
And you can't walk  

So I'm not sure  
You could save  
Britain from invasion.  

But the tear that  
Falls from my face  
Achieves much more than that.  

I often think  
Of the men that  
Died in fields and gutters  

So that I could be free.  
If only they could know  
That this expensive tear  

Falls from a very grateful father.
